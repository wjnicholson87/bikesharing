## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to work with data visualization software, Tableau, to dissect bike-sharing data from New Your City in order to present a business proposal for a new bike-sharing company.

## Summary:
This analysis is useful for developing data needed when developing a bike ride share company. It uses sample NYC data to demonstrate how we can analyze different rider demographics, ride times/peak usage, and develop visual tools for bike maintenance. 
In the future I would attempt to calculate age from the information in Birth year and the Start time columns. I feel like specific age communicates data more clearly. It would also be important to load in other data to ensure the analysis performs consistently amongst various data of the same format.
